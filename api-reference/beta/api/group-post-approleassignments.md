# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to assign an app role to a group. All direct members of the group will be considered assigned. To grant an app role assignment to a group, you need three identifiers:

- **principalId**: The ID of the **group** to which you are assigning the app role.
- **resourceId**: The ID of the resource **servicePrincipal** that has defined the app role.
- **appRoleId**: The ID of the **appRole** (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the group.

Additional licenses might be required to [use a group to manage access to applications](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-saasapps).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups/{groupId}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md). Specify other writable properties as necessary for your **appRoleAssignment**.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| appRoleId | Guid | The identifier (**id**) for the [app role](../resources/approle.md) which is assigned to the principal. This app role must be exposed in the **appRoles** property on the resource application's service principal (**resourceId**). If the resource application has not declared any app roles, a default app role ID of `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` can be specified to signal that the principal is assigned to the resource app without any specific app roles. |
| principalId | Guid | The unique identifier (**id**) for the [group](../resources/group.md) being granted the app role. |
| resourceId | Guid | The unique identifier (**id**) for the resource [service principal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) for which the assignment is made. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

Here is an example of the request. In this example, ID in the URL and value of **principalId** would both be the ID of the assigned group.
